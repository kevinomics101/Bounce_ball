# WEEK-12-PROJECT

# Bounce Ball
The goal of the Bouncing Ball Game is to hit all targets as many times as you can to earn the highest score. Every time the ball hits the Target you earn 1 points, and if it hits 2 targets you earn 2 points, respectively. If the player fail to catch the ball on the bar then "game over" will appear on the game window.
You play this game on a simulated terminal, with a textual interface.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the bounce_ball module and click the "run" icon.
